# onsenguide

An app to base the upcoming Onsen UI guide on. It's still a mishmash of ideas at the moment, but the intention is to
show the reader how to use Onsen UI components to build functionality that is common in mobile apps. For example:

- Navigating tabs and pages
- Authenticating user login
- Paging data from a remote API
- Displaying large lists efficiently
- Showing a swipeable gallery of images


## Installing

`npm install -g monaca && npm install`


## Running

- Run on device with Monaca debugger: `monaca debug`
- Preview in web browser: `monaca preview`
